Object model is represented by next classes:
 - Town - represent nodes of the graph
 - Route (as composition of destination Town and distance) - represents edges of the graph
both classes you may find in /core.

All existing routes are stored in special class
 - RoutesHandler (/handlers ).
This class also in charge of getting different information about the routes.

All kinds of information needed may be separated to 3 main scopes:
1. Finding distance for exact trip
2. Finding the shortest distance from one town to another
3. Finding the number of trips by some condition
For these purpose there are created 3 service classes:
 - DictanceFinder
 - ShortestDistanceFinder
 - NumberOfTripsFinder
 these classes are connected via interface:
 - Finder
 and they all putted to folder /finders

 For determining conditions of finding the numbers of trips from point One to point To
  created special enums:
  - LimitsBy - for determinigs either DISTANCE condition or number of STOPS condition
  - CompareTypes - for determining compare conditions (LESS, LESS_OR_EQUALS, EQUALS)
  enums are put into /enums folder
