Object model is represented by next classes:
 - Town - represent nodes of the graph
 - Route (as composition of destination Town and distance) - represents edges of the graph
 - Trip - for trips which is contains of several routes
these classes you may find in /core.

All existing towns are stored in special class
 - RoutesHandler (/handlers ).
This class also in charge of getting different information about the routes.

All kinds of information needed may be separated to 3 main scopes:
1. Finding distance for exact trip
2. Finding the shortest distance from one town to another
3. Finding the number of trips by some condition
Distance for the whole trip contains in class Trip
For the next 2 points there are created 2 service classes:
 - ShortestDistanceFinder
 - NumberOfTripsFinder
 these classes are connected via interface:
 - Finder
 and they all putted to folder /finders

 For determining conditions of finding the numbers of trips from point One to point To
  created special enums:
  - LimitsBy - for determinigs either DISTANCE condition or number of STOPS condition
  - CompareTypes - for determining compare conditions (LESS, LESS_OR_EQUALS, EQUALS)
  enums are put into /enums folder
