Object model is represented by 2 classes:
 - Town - represent nodes of the graph
 - Route (as composition of destination Town and distance) - represents edges of the graph
these classes you may find in /core.

There are also 2 service classes in folder /services:
 - TripService - to contain the trip as several routes one-by-one. This class also can calculate the distance of the trip.
 - TownService - this class contains the map of the towns.

The main class which connects all the classes and is able to ask any class to information needed for user:
 - RoutesHandler (/handlers ).

All kinds of information needed for user may be separated to 3 main scopes:
1. Finding distance for exact trip
2. Finding the shortest distance from one town to another
3. Finding the number of trips by some condition

Distance for the whole trip calculated and stored in class TripService
For the next points there are 2 service classes created:
 - ShortestDistanceFinder
 - NumberOfTripsFinder
 these classes are connected via interface:
 - Finder
 and they all putted to folder /finders

 For determining conditions of finding the numbers of trips from point One to point To
  created special enums:
  - LimitsBy - for determinigs either DISTANCE condition or number of STOPS condition required
  - CompareTypes - for determining compare conditions (LESS, LESS_OR_EQUALS, EQUALS).
  Enums are put into /enums folder
